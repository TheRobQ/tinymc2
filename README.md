There are two versions, one of which is noted out.  

The second exposes the methods so they are accessible in the format 
var mySalutation = Salutation("name", "last"), and works invoking them through mySalutation.fullName() as directed.

The uncommented out library should work as directed form the assignment sheet. 

The commented library will also expose the methods, but works as Salutation.fullNmae("first", "last")
